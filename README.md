<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud

**2)** Choose between one of the 3 versions, Normal, Centred, Box. You can see the differences from the screenshots album!

**3)** Copy the desired Deli Hud folder

**4)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder for example (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Deli Hud Normal)

**NOTES:**

I suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.

The original rgb code for the damage numbers is: hud_combattext_red 255; hud_combattext_green 0; hud_combattext_blue 114


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====

All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/crosshairs/Crosshair.res file.

Change the **"visible"** value to **"1"** to enable the hud crosshair and change the **"labelText"** value to switch the crosshair style, checkout the Crosshairs.png in order to see all the possible options!

It is also possible to easily animate the crosshair to turn red on damage by editing the scripts/crosshairs/Animations_Crosshairs.res file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
